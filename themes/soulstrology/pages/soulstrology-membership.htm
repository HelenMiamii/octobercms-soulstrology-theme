      <h4>Soulstrology has given me the tools to be the co-creator of my life with confidence! Over the past years I have been able to use Soulstrology as catalyst to my healing process and as an opportunity to develop a secure relationship to myself and others. Can’t recommend it enough!</h4>

      <h4>I absolutely love the Soulstrology Members Realm. There are countless ways to connect with the cosmos, from sensory experiences to informative yet digestible information about upcoming transits.  The meditations, soundbaths and suggested rituals allow me to cultivate practice self-inquiry and help me to feel as if I am truly co-creating this life with the universe.  I joined hoping to learn more about astrology and my own chart but what I wasn't expecting to gain a deep self-acceptance and self-compassion through astrology.</h4>

      <h4>Ambi showed up at the perfect time and in the perfect way in my life! Her podcast was like a nice big sip of water after being in a desert. I then found out about Soulstrology and it’s been such a blessing. The community is so wonderful and supportive. Ambi’s coaching calls, check ins, etc. have deepened my own spiritual progress. I dived deeper into my spirituality and discovered my soul purpose. So divine! Thanks Ambi!</h4>
