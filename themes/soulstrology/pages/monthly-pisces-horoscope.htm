        <p>You have been facing some resistance, and maybe even anger regarding earned income and security a Mars retrograde has been holding back action and momentum in this area of your life. Over the course of the month, you are being asked in a number of ways to be patient, trust, and perhaps rely on a partner or money from another source, taking you out of your comfort zone. Mars won't build up much speed through November, but it at least won't be moving backward after the 13th. The end of the month brings an interesting lunar eclipse to your home sector, drawing your attention towards the north node of fate. This means you are in a cycle of changes on the axis of your family/home life and your career life. The end of this month is asking for you to be open to emotional release regarding your family or ancestral connections so you may move forward in a more authentic way in establishing what home means to you.</p>
