        <p>The month begins on the heels of a full moon in your sign, bringing to light some new insights regarding your identity and what you value. During this time, you may also feel at odds with needing to give attention to your day-to-day life, maintaining your health while items surface in your mind and heart that need some spiritual attention. By mid-month, you find the balance there but are still feeling some pressure on you mentally regarding responsibilities. This month, it's important to still carve out time for some meditation or another practice that helps ease the mental chatter, so it doesn't weigh you down. At the end of the month, you have the lunar eclipse happening in your house of possessions and material security. Take note if ideas begin to percolate regarding a change in job, income, or material desires. With an eclipse, these items might not shift for a couple of months, but it usually moves something out of our life so you can step into greater alignment.</p>
