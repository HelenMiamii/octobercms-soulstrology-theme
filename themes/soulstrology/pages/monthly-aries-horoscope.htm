        <p>Hello, mighty Aries! You may be feeling some pressure right now, particularly in career and its effects on your partnership. Communication overall may feel intense or heavy during this time. This includes your inner chatter and mindset. It won’t last forever, but since Mercury is retrograde, do think before you speak, and read every line of your emails and contracts…twice at least. Also, your love dynamic may be triggering some old patterns of behavior. If you feel sensitive, take some time to reflect on what is coming up and how you want to move forward. Midmonth will likely require some type of solution or concession between your relationship and work-life, but this tension eases by the end of the month. On the 30th, the lunar eclipse will start a cycle of change in your house of communication. This could be that what you are studying, speaking about, or sharing shifts, or how you are communicating, to whom, or even the communication with yourself.
