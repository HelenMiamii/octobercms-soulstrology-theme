        <p>You have been having a powerful year. This month will continue the journey, but you have your ruling planet of Venus in your sign softening some of the edges and bringing a glow and boost to your personal expression. The start of the month may find your mind consumed with responsibilities at home or with your family. Choose your words, thoughtfully. The Sun is also making his way through your house of earned income and possessions, shining a light on your personal finances. The second week of November is an excellent time for you to get your ducks in a row and review this past year, and plan for 2021. The new moon will happen in this same area of your chart so you can plant seeds of what you want to bring in. You only have the new moon here once a year, so use it to its fullest potential, especially since it's a super moon!</p>
