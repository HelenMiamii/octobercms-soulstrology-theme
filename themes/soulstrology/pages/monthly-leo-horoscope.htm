    <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">
        <p>The month starts with a potent full moon in your house of career, moving stagnant energy and bringing unexpected insight or ideas into your consciousness. You may be feeling a little caged in and longing for some experience or adventure to break out of the intensity of your day-to-day life. There will be an opportunity for more traction on interests or maybe even a short trip later in the month, going into December as Mars stations direct in the area of your chart that oversees travel, study, and publication. Venus (the planet of love and enjoyment of the good life) moves through your house of communication and neighbors. So, having a small, socially-distanced dinner with a few friends will go a long way to bring balance and pleasure to your life this November!</p>
