<p><h2>SOULSTROLOGY TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND DISCLAIMER</h2></p>
Soulstrology is our very own version of astrology which we refer to as cosmic consciousness or cosmic coaching but for the purposes of the law it may be deemed traditional astrology.
<br></br>
We very much believe in astrology and Soulstrology. We also have an equal belief and respect in the law, adhering to the law and being fully transparent. 
<br></br>
We are required by the law to have this legal disclaimer for and on the site.
<br></br>
All readings, whether in person, phone, recorded or purchased via our online store are for entertainment purposes only. 
<br></br>
No guarantee can be given or is given (expressly or implicitly) or should be assumed for, or about the accuracy of a reading. 
<br></br>
You are responsible for your own life choices and decisions and your choices are yours to make. 
<br></br>
We are not qualified to give legal, financial, medical, psychological, psychiatric or any other specialist advice and nothing said in a reading, either expressly or implicitly can be deemed to be such advice. 
<br></br>
If you require such advice you should seek a licensed professional. 
<br></br>
Our services are not available to anyone under the age of 18 unless they are requested by a parent or legal guardian.
<br></br>
Our founder has provided readings and created Soulstrology profiles for newborns and young children at their parents and/or legal guardians request but under the express condition that this was for entertainment only.
<br></br>
Our founder has used her discretion in these readings and obviously a reading at birth, or during young childhood will differ considerably from a reading when the child is over 18.
<br></br>
Please keep this in mind if you choose to purchase an automated reading from our site for a third party who is under 18 from our online store as such a reading is created through an algorithm and a database full of astrological interpretations and is likely to be tailored to an adult.
<br></br>
Please also note that our online readings are created by a computer software program which pulls from a database of information written by a team of highly experienced professional astrologers.
<br></br>
These readings are detailed, insightful and provide both accurate and helpful information to understanding either your natal chart, a relationship chart, current and upcoming transits but are not the same as a one to one session with our founder or any Soulstrology affiliated astrologers.
<br></br>
Readings (whether computer generated and purchased via our site, or a one to one session with our founder, or any Soulstrology affiliated astrologers) can contain seemingly contradictory information, but this simply represents the complex and at times contradictory aspects of a human personality, relationship dynamics and/or current astrological transits impacting an individual.
<br></br>
All sales are final and no refunds are available.
<br></br>
By using the services on this website (including subscribing as Soulstrology Membership via our sister site (<a href="https://www.alchemywithambi.com">www.alchemywithambi.com</a>) and purchasing a reading you confirm that you are over 18 and that you understand and agree with all of the Terms and Conditions of my Website (including the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy) as well as the terms of this Disclaimer.
