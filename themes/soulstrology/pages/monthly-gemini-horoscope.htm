    <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">
        <p>The month begins with illumination in the spiritual area of your chart. Insight from your subconscious usually obscured by your conscious mind's vastness and business may come into greater focus. Deepening the work you are doing on intimacy and connection with yourself or a partner. Midmonth around the 16th brings about new ideas or unexpected news or interruptions. Stay open to the information coming through â€“ it may not make rational sense but is serving to connect with your higher self. At the end of the month, the lunar eclipse is happening in your house of self-identity. Bringing about a 6-month process of letting go and rebirthing. Eclipses move out what is expired and no longer in alignment. Since you have been undergoing a lot of transformational work in the last year, you may need to reassess how you see yourself. How you identify and give yourself credit for the evolution and release any ego attachments to who you used to be.</p>
