        <p>This month brings your focus to your career and your purpose. While you have been undergoing a major soul-level reconstruction that is preparing you for how you evolve in your identity over the next couple of years, you have probably also been looking at the work you do in the world. Scorpio season is highlighting this even more and is giving you a boost of energy and recognition. The new moon here mid-month is the perfect opportunity to clarify your intention regarding what you want to achieve in your career moving forward, even if that brings with it some restructuring to your home life, like a change in locations or moving into a sprinter van! Venus will spend most of the month lighting up your need for travel and experiences, so even if you can't get out of town, at least adventure to a new restaurant or treat yourself to a new subscription or course on a topic that sparks inspiration in your inner student.</p>
