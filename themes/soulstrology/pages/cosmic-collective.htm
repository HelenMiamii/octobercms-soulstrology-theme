                            <h2 class="mb-4 text-gold">AMBI KAVANAGH</h2>
                            <p>Ambi Kavanagh (née Sitham) is the founder of Soulstrology.com.</p>
                            <p>Soulstrology was birthed through Ambi’s awakening over a decade ago which she describes as a *<i>cosmic bitch slap</i>*. She began to study astrology in depth and specifically the impact of celestial transits upon her chart, and thus her life. In doing so she realized there was a way of working with the planetary energies to overcome challenges, manifest her desires, and last but not least, to expand her consciousness and become a better member of the human race.</p>
                            <p>Ambi began to use Soulstrology to guide her coaching clients and mentees over the years with great success. She also created Soulstrology Soundbaths fusing cosmic consciousness with sound healing which have received high praise from <b>goop</b>, <b>Vogue</b> and <b>The Hollywood Reporter</b>. All of this inspired Ambi to democratize the teachings of Soulstrology through forming the Membership which to her is a beloved community. Her mission is to educate and empower the community to work with celestial energies to become best versions of themselves, live more fulfilling lives, and in turn contribute to the <i>greater good</i>.</p>
                            <p>Her life mantra has become Soulstrology’s motto: I’m With The Cosmos</p>

                            <p>Based in Los Angeles, Nina Singh is an Advanced Akashic Record Reader. Nina was drawn to the Akashic Records because they offered a medium to heal and reconnect with the soul. In her first Akashic Reading Nina describes feeling seen, understood and supported in ways she had never felt before. Nina realized she needed to share this powerful work with others. So, with the help of her Masters, Teachers and Loved Ones (MTLOs) and her teacher, Helen Vonderheide, she got certified and began building her business. Nina is excited to share this work with the Soulstrology community. Nina’s Akashic Cosmic Consciousness offering will tap into our collective records. Nina will engage with our MTLOs and share their messages, guidance and wisdom as we navigate the months and weeks ahead!</p>
