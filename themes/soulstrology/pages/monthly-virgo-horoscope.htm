        <p>At the start of November, there may be some tension around finances and security that chips away at feeling creative or spontaneous. These triggers could stem from childhood and feed into an idea that perhaps you can't depend on someone else to hold stability for you. You are feeling very pressured to be responsible and do things practically. However, the best medicine may be to write out or speak alou these fears or concerns, even if it's just to yourself in your car, so that you can hear them and take some of the power out of them. The mind can really build up these ideas, but once you speak or write them and face any shadow, you can begin to process them. This will set you up nicely to be open to the lunar eclipse at the end of the month happening in your house of career, which is sure to usher in a new chapter of how you are showing up in the world and the work you are doing!</p>
