        <p> You are in the countdown until your birthday! So in these last weeks, the moon's cycles are a great way to reflect, release, and highlight where you are and where you want to go. The month begins by lighting up your health and daily activities. There may be some sudden or dramatic shifts occurring here due to spiritual insight and growth. The new moon midmonth will happen in the area of your chart that oversees your cosmic connection to source, helping to usher in a new chapter that will be reinforced by the lunar eclipse in Sagittarius at the end of the month. This is a significant time of change in all of your ego and your soul. You are moving into a new incarnation so let go of what is falling away. Try to do so with grace and excitement for what is emerging!</p>
