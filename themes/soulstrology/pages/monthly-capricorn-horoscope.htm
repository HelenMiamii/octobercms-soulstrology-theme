        <p>Your sign has been the epicenter of massive collective and personal changes! You are in the final months of so much intensity, and it must feel good to be in the home stretch of this restructure so you can do what you do best, which is build and grow something of meaning and stability. This month is asking you to connect with your friends and network. Those you trust and deeply love are here and looking to commune with you! The new moon mid-month further pulls attention to your network and maybe the start of a new connection that bears fruit over the next six months.</p>
        
        <p>Venus, the planet of love, beauty, and pleasure, is also moving through your career, adding a little glow over your work. This will especially feel good once Mercury stations direct in this same area of your chart on November 3rd, and then they both are working to your benefit. The month wraps with an eclipse in your house of daily life and health, perhaps bringing forth a new level of awareness to the small details like what you are eating, how you are sleeping, how you are moving through your day that has a big overall impact.</p>
