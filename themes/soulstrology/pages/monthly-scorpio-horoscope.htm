        <p> Happy Birthday, Scorpios! Of course, since the Sun is in your sign most of the month, you are probably doing a self-assessment of the year past and looking towards the year ahead. The month starts with the full moon in your house of partnership, illuminating and releasing anything that needs to move for you to step into your highest self-expression. The Sun is having a conversation with the revolutionary Uranus, sparking a desire for unconventionality and bolts of inspiration. You have also been transforming your mind, what you think, how you communicate with yourself and others, and what responsibility you take  with your voice. For the new moon happening in your sign, consider it an additional birthday and moment to root your intention of implementing all the lessons and changes from this year.</p>
